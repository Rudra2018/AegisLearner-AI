python3 -c "
from ethical_bounty_research import EthicalBountyResearcher
from pathlib import Path

researcher = EthicalBountyResearcher()

# Create comprehensive educational package
platforms = ['huntr', 'hackerone', 'google']
for platform in platforms:
    print(f'=== {platform.upper()} EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ===')
    researcher.display_program_requirements(platform)
    print()

# Generate compliance documentation
researcher.create_educational_research_summary()
print('📚 Educational materials generated in reports/ directory')
print('⚠️  Remember: This is educational content only - always refer to official sources')
"
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide provides educational information about bug bounty platforms and ethical security research practices. The QuantumSentinel-Nexus framework emphasizes:

### Key Principles
1. **Authorization First**: Never test without explicit permission
2. **Educational Focus**: Learn proper procedures before attempting practical application
3. **Ethical Standards**: Maintain the highest professional and ethical standards
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all activities comply with applicable laws
5. **Professional Development**: Focus on building legitimate security expertise

### Important Reminders
- **This guide is educational only** - actual participation requires proper authorization
- **Always refer to official platform documentation** for current requirements
- **Consult legal counsel** when in doubt about authorization or compliance
- **Respect the security community** by maintaining ethical standards

**Final Note**: The goal of bug bounty participation should be to improve security for everyone, not to bypass important safeguards. Success comes from quality research, professional conduct, and strict adherence to ethical and legal boundaries.
