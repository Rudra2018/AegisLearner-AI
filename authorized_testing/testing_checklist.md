# Mobile Security Testing Checklist

## Pre-Testing Authorization âœ…
- [ ] Written authorization obtained from app owner
- [ ] Testing scope clearly defined and documented
- [ ] Legal compliance verified (bug bounty terms, academic approval, etc.)
- [ ] Testing environment isolated from production systems
- [ ] Data handling and privacy requirements understood

## Static Analysis Testing
- [ ] Source code security scan completed
- [ ] Binary analysis performed (if applicable)
- [ ] Configuration security assessed
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities checked
- [ ] Hardcoded secrets analysis completed

## Dynamic Analysis Testing (Authorized Apps Only)
- [ ] Testing environment properly configured
- [ ] Network traffic analysis setup (proxy, SSL interception)
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms tested
- [ ] Session management security verified
- [ ] Input validation testing completed
- [ ] SQL injection testing performed
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing conducted

## Mobile-Specific Security Testing
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate pinning tested
- [ ] Data storage security assessed (keychain, shared preferences)
- [ ] Inter-process communication security verified
- [ ] Device security features tested (biometric, screen lock bypass)
- [ ] Runtime manipulation resistance tested
- [ ] Jailbreak/root detection mechanisms evaluated

## Evidence Collection
- [ ] Screenshots captured for each vulnerability
- [ ] Video recordings made for complex exploitation
- [ ] Network traffic logs saved
- [ ] Tool outputs and configurations documented
- [ ] Sensitive information properly redacted
- [ ] Testing timeline documented

## Reporting and Disclosure
