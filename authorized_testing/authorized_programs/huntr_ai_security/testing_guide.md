- **Focus:** AI/ML security vulnerabilities in open source projects
- **Mobile Scope:** Mobile ML frameworks and model implementations
- **Bounties:** $500 - $4,000 based on vulnerability impact

## Authorized Mobile ML Testing Targets

### High Value Targets ($4,000 bounties)
1. **TensorRT Mobile Implementation**
   - Focus: GPU acceleration vulnerabilities on mobile
   - Testing: Model inference security, memory corruption
   - Evidence: Proof-of-concept with malicious model files

2. **ONNX Mobile Runtime**
   - Focus: Cross-platform ML inference vulnerabilities
   - Testing: Model parsing, runtime exploitation
   - Evidence: Mobile-specific exploitation demonstration

3. **TensorFlow Lite Security**
   - Focus: Mobile TensorFlow implementation
   - Testing: Model validation bypass, inference attacks
   - Platform: iOS and Android TensorFlow Lite

### Mobile-Specific Testing Methodology

#### iOS Core ML Security Testing
```bash
# Set up iOS testing environment
# Install required tools for Core ML analysis
pip install coremltools
pip install protobuf

# Analyze Core ML model security
coremltools-convert --source mlmodel --destination analysis
```

#### Android ML Kit Testing
```bash
# Set up Android ML testing
# Install Android ML analysis tools
pip install tensorflow-lite-tools

# Test TensorFlow Lite model security
tflite_convert --saved_model_dir=model --output_file=model.tflite
```
